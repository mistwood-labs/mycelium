# proto

Protocol buffer definitions for mycelium.

## Structure

- `p2p/`  
  Protocols used for peer-to-peer messaging between nodes.
  
## Notes

These `.proto` files are used for defining lightweight and portable messages, not for gRPC services.

The P2P communication uses custom serialization based on these schemas.
