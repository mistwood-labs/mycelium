# mycelium

mycelium is an experimental decentralized communication protocol under development by mistwood-labs.

At this stage, we are exploring minimal peer-to-peer architectures, silent data propagation, and resilient trust models.

Details of the protocol will be made public when the project reaches a more stable phase.

## Status

- Early exploration phase
- Private internal discussions
- Initial proof-of-concept implementations ongoing

## License

This project will be open-sourced under a permissive license once the initial development goals are achieved.
